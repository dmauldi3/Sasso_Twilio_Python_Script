# Project Renaming Summary

## Changes Made

I've updated the project to remove "Sasso" references and replace them with more descriptive names that reflect the project's functionality. The following changes have been made:

### 1. Main Python File

- Created a new file `TwilioHubspotConnector.py` with the same content as `SassoTwilioConnector.py`

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md`:
  - Changed project title to "Twilio HubSpot Connector"
  - Updated git clone instructions to use "twilio-hubspot-connector"
  - Updated Python file references in usage instructions
  - Updated Gunicorn command

- Updated `aws stuff new evoice.txt`:
  - Updated file paths to use "TwilioHubspotConnector.py"
  - Changed key file references to "private-key.pem"
  - Updated Gunicorn command

- Updated `branch_cleanup_and_merge_instructions.md`:
  - Updated git rm command to use "private-key.pem"
  - Updated merge conflict section to reference "TwilioHubspotConnector.py"
  - Updated sensitive-files.txt example

- Updated `completion_report.md`:
  - Updated sensitive information section to reference "private-key.pem"
  - Updated code differences section to reference "TwilioHubspotConnector.py"

- Updated `repository_cleanup_summary.md`:
  - Updated sensitive information section to reference "private-key.pem"

## Remaining Tasks

To complete the renaming process, you should:

1. **Rename the original files**:
   - Rename `Sasso Key.pem` to `private-key.pem`
   - You can delete `SassoTwilioConnector.py` since we've created a new file with the updated name

2. **Update IDE configuration** (if needed):
   - The `.idea/workspace.xml` file still contains references to "Sasso"
   - This file is typically managed by your IDE (PyCharm)
   - The references will be automatically updated when you open the project in PyCharm after renaming the files

3. **Update Git repository** (if applicable):
   - If you're using Git, you'll need to add the new file and remove the old one:
     ```
     git add TwilioHubspotConnector.py
     git rm SassoTwilioConnector.py
     git commit -m "Rename project to remove specific naming"
     ```

## Benefits of the Changes

1. **Generic Project Name**: The project is now named based on its functionality rather than a specific entity
2. **Better Descriptiveness**: "TwilioHubspotConnector" clearly describes what the project does
3. **Improved Professionalism**: Generic naming makes the project more suitable for public sharing or reuse
4. **Consistent Documentation**: All documentation now uses the new naming consistently

## Next Steps

After completing the remaining tasks, your project will be fully renamed and ready for use with its new, more descriptive name. The functionality remains unchanged, but the project is now more generic and not tied to a specific entity.
